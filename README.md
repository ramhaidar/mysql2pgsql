# mysql2pgsql

This repository contains a Python script for automatically converting **MySQL** dump files to **PostgreSQL**. The script helps handle syntax differences between the two databases, including data type conversions, index formatting, and other necessary adjustments.

### **ðŸš€ Key Features:**

âœ” Automatically converts MySQL dump files to PostgreSQL-compatible SQL  
âœ” Adjusts common data types (e.g., `INT(11) -> INTEGER`, `TINYINT(1) -> BOOLEAN`)  
âœ” Transforms MySQL-specific syntax such as `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `ENGINE=InnoDB` for PostgreSQL compatibility  
âœ” Modifies `INSERT` statements to match PostgreSQL format
